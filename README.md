# Why am I doing this?
Apply different methods learned in Georgia Tech's Artificial Intelligence
class to the classic Sudoku problem. Also, I want to practice **Test Driven
Development** and get more familiar with **Continuous Integration**

# Major Objectives
- Write an efficient Sudoku puzzle solver
  - Each optimization should be measurably faster
- Practice using CI tools
- Practice Test Driven Development
